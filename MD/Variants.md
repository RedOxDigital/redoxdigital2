You are an expert UX/UI designer and front-end developer. Your task is to generate **four completely unique and structurally distinct HTML and Tailwind CSS Hero Section components**.

The primary objective is to provide four conceptually different design approaches (focusing on layout, structure, visual hierarchy, and imagery style) so that a designer can easily mix and match elements from each to create a final, refined component.

### **Constraints**

1.  **Component:**  (will be given)
2.  **Technology:** Use standard HTML5 structure and **Tailwind CSS classes** for all styling. The code must be clean, maintainable, and easily integrated into a React/Vite environment (no external libraries other than standard Tailwind).
3.  **Copy (Must Be Identical):** 

### **Design Variant Requirements**

The four variants must be maximally different from one another. Each must represent a distinct design approach:

* **Vary the Layout:** Use different structural patterns (e.g., stacked, side-by-side, split-screen, full-bleed text, centered, edge-anchored).
* **Vary the Visual Element Treatment:** Use different placeholders for images/visuals (e.g., device mockups, abstract shapes, large photography, subtle patterns).
* **Vary the Typography:** Use different combinations of font-weight, size, and alignment to create unique visual hierarchies for the headline, subhead, and CTA buttons.

Provide a brief description (1-2 sentences) before the code for each variant explaining the unique design approach taken.

**Output Format:** Provide the description and the full HTML/Tailwind code for each of the four variants.

Please make sure the group of Varient are put into one new folder in Folder DI
